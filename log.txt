7/3:
got unet on osc to work on og synthset, couldn't get it to work on anything else
Problem on others: dice score stagnates
- maybe this doesn't have to be a problem, try training on other dataset to completion + predicting
Problem on og synthset: loss values spike insanely high - I think this is because of 
investigated params, did not seem to be source of problem, however
- batch size of >1 will crash model when training on og synthset
- the higher the validation percentage, the higher both epoch loss and dice loss are
to investigate:
negative samples affecting dice loss results (tested other loss fncs, didn't work)
set class size to 1 instead of multiclass (this caused error in the past but maybe can configure it to work)
cropping negative samples or somehow ignoring/masking them

trying on other datasets
synthset-2.1: just not enough positive images I think which is really fucking up the dice score
- try other methods of loss score again bc I was being stupid last time and not refreshing the kernel

todo:
try it on other datasets again

bugfixes:
to fix "cannot resize data" issue, resize all images to 256x256

reflection: look for things in imported modules! tracing is hella important
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP TRACK OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING, UNDERSTAND THE ASSIGNMENT AND DON'T FALL DOWN A RABBIT HOLE

7/7:
trying to make synthset look more like cbus
In Blender, for all roads -> add brightness/contrast node between img tex and principled bsdf, set brightness to 0.3

7/26:
copypaste from report:
If OpenStreetMap data has too many gaps, we turn to CityEngine’s built-in synthetic generation capabilities. By drawing a street around the entire terrain and connecting gaps where necessary, we can divide the entire scene into lots and adjust lot generation settings to imitate terrain (using recursive generation=off is usually a good start). 

Blosm could also be worth investigating as a future tool for potentially much less cost than CityEngine. 

Initial experiments with rural areas led to the conclusion that an entirely new method was necessary, perhaps taking inspiration from [something] et al.’s mosaic method.
